## Description
The React Joke Generator provides jokes on demand! Just click the button to receive a setup for a joke and then click again to see the punchline.

## User Story
As a user, a jumbotron appears with a button saying "Get A Joke." Once that button is clicked, a setup for a random joke is retrieved from an API and it will show on the DOM. The user can then click the button that says "Answer," and the punchline to the joke will appear.

## Technologies used
